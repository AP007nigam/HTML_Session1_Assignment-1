<p><u>Graffiti are writing or drawings that have been scribbled, scratched,or painted illicitly on a wall or other surface, 
often within public view.Graffiti range from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and they have existed since ancient times,
 with examples dating back to Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and the Roman Empire.</u>

<br>
<p><i>In modern times, paint (particularly spray paint) and marker pens have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. 
In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and vandalism, which is a 
punishable crime</i>
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon 
spray paint graffiti styles. Within hip hop culture, graffiti have evolved alongside hip hop music, b-boying, and other elements.Unrelated 
to hip-hop graffiti,[citation needed] gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related 
activities.</b>

<p><i>Both "graffiti" and its occasional singular form "graffito" are from the Italian word graffiato ("scratched"). "Graffiti" is applied in 
art history to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is "sgraffito", which involves scratching through
one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it.</i></p>
<p><b> This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes chalk or coal were used. 
The word originates from Greek -graphein â€” meaning "to write."</b></p>
